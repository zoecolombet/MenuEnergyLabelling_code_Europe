# MenuEnergyLabelling_code_Europe
This repository shares the code for our analysis of the health impact of implementing menu calory labelling in Europe. The results are published in a paper: Putra IGNE, Oâ€™Flaherty M, Emmert-Fees KMF, Vasquez MS, Evans R, Peters A, Kypridemos C, Berger N, Robinson E, Colombet Z. Estimating the impact of mandatory menu calorie labelling policy and sugar-sweetened beverage taxes on adult obesity prevalence and cardiovascular mortality in two European countries: a simulation modelling study 2024:2024.11.18.24317496. medRxIV 2024 https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.18.24317496.

# NOTE FOR USERS
    
    Belgium --> with _200s (scale factor of 200)
    Germany --> with _500s (scale factor of 500)

    _direct --> The total effect of SSB (direct & indirect)
    _indirect --> The indirect effect of SSB only

    new_results --> changes the response effect of menu labelling from an absolute (-47 kcal) to relative (-7.3%)
