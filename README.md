This repository shares the code for our analysis of the health impact of implementing menu calory labelling in Europe. The results of our analysis are currently submitted in a peer-reviewed paper.

This repository contains the following files:

    dyn_menu_labelling_belgium - MC - foreach v1.7.R: codes for running the model in Belgium
    dyn_menu_labelling_germany - MC - foreach v1.7.R: codes for running the model in Germany
